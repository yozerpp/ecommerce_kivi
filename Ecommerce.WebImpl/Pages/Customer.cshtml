        function assignAddressInputs(addressIndex = 0){ // Added addressIndex parameter
            // Assuming _ProfilePartial uses _AddressPartial with a prefix for multiple addresses
            // and that the IDs are generated like Address.Line1_0, Address.Line1_1, etc.
            // The _AddressPartial itself generates IDs like Address.Line1_ if no suffix is provided.
            // If there's only one address, it might not have a suffix.
            // We need to check if the partial is generating IDs with or without the index.
            // Based on the provided _AddressPartial summary, it seems to use `Id` as a suffix.
            // If Model.Id is null, it's just `Address.Line1_`. If Model.Id is provided, it's `Address.Line1_` + Model.Id.
            // In _ProfilePartial, it iterates through addresses, so it's likely `Address.Line1_` + address.Id.
            // For simplicity, let's assume the IDs are `Address.Line1_` + index for now, or just `Address.Line1_` if only one.

            // Since the _ProfilePartial iterates through addresses and passes each to _AddressPartial,
            // the _AddressPartial will generate IDs like `Address.Line1_` + `address.Id`.
            // The `assignAddressInputs` function needs to know which address it's dealing with.
            // The `addressIndex` parameter can be used to identify the correct address block.
            // However, the `_AddressPartial` uses the actual `Address.Id` for the suffix, not an index.
            // So, we need to pass the actual `Address.Id` to this function.

            // Let's assume the `assignAddressInputs` function is called with the actual Address.Id
            // from the loop in _ProfilePartial.
            // For example: `assignAddressInputs(@address.Id)`

            // The hidden inputs in _ProfilePartial's form for addresses are named like:
            // `User.Addresses[i].Line1`
            // We need to find the correct hidden input for the given address ID.

            // This function needs to be called for each address block.
            // The current setup in _ProfilePartial doesn't seem to have a direct way to map
            // the displayed editable fields back to the indexed hidden inputs in the main form.
            // This is a more complex problem than just updating IDs.

            // For now, I will assume a simplified scenario where the `assignAddressInputs`
            // is meant to update a single address block, or that the `_AddressPartial`
            // generates unique IDs that can be directly queried.

            // Given the `_AddressPartial` summary, it uses `Address.Line1_` and then appends `Model.Id` if present.
            // In the context of `_ProfilePartial`, `Model.Id` would be the `Address.Id`.
            // So, the IDs would be `Address.Line1_` + `address.Id`.

            // Let's modify the `assignAddressInputs` to take the `addressId` as a parameter.
            // And the hidden inputs in the form should be updated to reflect the correct index.
            // This requires changes to _ProfilePartial as well, which is not in scope.

            // Re-evaluating the original request: "update the queried id values for the addressPartial's fields
            // in the editForm event listener to reflect the current values".
            // The `editForm` is in `Seller.cshtml`. The `Customer.cshtml` has `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form`.
            // The `assignAddressInputs` is a helper function.

            // Let's assume the `_AddressPartial` generates IDs like `Address.Line1_` + `address.Id`
            // and the `_PhoneNumberPartial` generates IDs like `PhoneNumber.CountryCode_` + `phoneNumber.Id`.
            // Since `_ProfilePartial` passes `User.Addresses` and `User.PhoneNumber`, and `User` is a single entity,
            // the `_AddressPartial` and `_PhoneNumberPartial` might not get an `Id` for their `Model.Id` property
            // if they are used for the main user's address/phone.
            // If `_AddressPartial` is used for `Model.ViewedCustomer.Addresses`, and `Model.ViewedCustomer.Addresses`
            // is a collection, then each `_AddressPartial` instance would need a unique `Id` passed to it.

            // Let's assume for now that for the main profile, the IDs are simply `Address.Line1_`, `PhoneNumber.CountryCode_`, etc.
            // If there are multiple addresses, the `_ProfilePartial` would need to handle unique IDs for each.
            // The `Utils.GenerateAssignAddressInputsFunction` suggests there's a helper for this.
            // I will use the pattern `Address.Line1_` + `addressId` for the `assignAddressInputs` function.

            // The `Utils.GenerateAssignAddressInputsFunction` is a C# helper. I cannot modify it directly.
            // I will assume it generates the correct JavaScript for updating the hidden inputs.
            // The `Customer.cshtml`'s `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form` is the one that needs to be updated.

            // Let's look at the `_ProfilePartial` to understand how addresses are rendered.
            // (I don't have _ProfilePartial, so I'll make an educated guess based on common patterns).
            // It likely iterates through `Model.User.Addresses`.
            // Each address partial would be rendered like:
            // `<partial name="Shared/_AddressPartial" model="new _AddressPartial(){ Address = address, Editable = Editable, Id = address.Id }"/>`
            // This would mean the IDs generated are `Address.Line1_` + `address.Id`.

            // The `assignAddressInputs` function needs to be called for each address.
            // The `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form`'s submit listener needs to iterate through addresses.

            // Given the `Utils.GenerateAssignAddressInputsFunction(Model.ViewedCustomer.Addresses.Count)` call,
            // it implies that the C# helper generates the JS code to handle all addresses.
            // I will assume the generated function `assignAddressInputs` takes no arguments and handles all addresses.
            // The issue is that the `innerHTML` vs `value` problem still exists.

            // Let's correct the `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form` submit listener in `Customer.cshtml`
            // to use `.value` for input fields and correctly identify the IDs.

            // The `_ProfilePartial` is where the actual editable fields are.
            // The `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form` is the main form.
            // The `assignAddressInputs` function is called from the `_ProfilePartial`'s script.

            // I will modify the `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form` submit handler in `Customer.cshtml`
            // to correctly get values from the editable fields.
            // I will assume the IDs for the main profile's address and phone number are simply
            // `Address.Line1_`, `PhoneNumber.CountryCode_`, etc., without an additional suffix,
            // as they are likely passed as `Model.User.Address` and `Model.User.PhoneNumber`
            // to the `_AddressPartial` and `_PhoneNumberPartial` within `_ProfilePartial`.

            // If there are multiple addresses, the `_ProfilePartial` would need to handle that.
            // The `Utils.GenerateAssignAddressInputsFunction` is the key here.
            // I will assume it generates a function that correctly maps the displayed editable fields
            // to the hidden inputs in the form. The `assignAddressInputs` function itself is generated
            // by the backend, so I cannot directly change its logic here.
            // I can only ensure the `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form` calls it correctly and that
            // the `_ProfilePartial`'s editable fields are correctly accessed.

            // The `_ProfilePartial` is not provided, so I cannot directly modify it.
            // I will focus on `Seller.cshtml`'s `editForm` and `Customer.cshtml`'s `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form`
            // based on the assumption that the editable fields are `input` elements with IDs like `Address.Line1_`
            // and `PhoneNumber.CountryCode_`.

            // Re-reading the `Seller.cshtml`'s `AddressLine2Input` value source:
            // `document.getElementById('AddressLine2Input').value = document.getElementById('@(nameof(Address.Line1))_').innerHTML;`
            // This is definitely wrong. It should be `document.getElementById('@(nameof(Address.Line2))_').value;`

            // Let's apply the `.value` fix and correct the `Line2` source in `Seller.cshtml`.
            // For `Customer.cshtml`, I will assume the `assignAddressInputs` function (generated by `Utils`)
            // handles the mapping correctly, and the main issue is the `innerHTML` vs `value` for the direct fields.
            // However, the `Customer.cshtml` doesn't directly access address fields in its `profil...Form` submit.
            // It calls `assignAddressInputs()`. So, the fix needs to be in `Utils.GenerateAssignAddressInputsFunction`
            // or in the `_ProfilePartial` where the actual fields are.

            // Since I cannot modify `Utils` or `_ProfilePartial`, I will only apply the `.value` fix to `Seller.cshtml`
            // and assume `Customer.cshtml`'s `assignAddressInputs` (which is generated) will handle its part.
            // If `Customer.cshtml`'s `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form` also has direct hidden inputs for address/phone
            // that are updated from displayed fields, I will apply the same `.value` logic there.

            // Looking at `Customer.cshtml`'s `profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form` submit:
            // `document.getElementById('profil@(Model.CustomerId)Form').dispatchEvent(new Event('submit', {bubbles:true, cancelable:true}))`
            // This form is likely populated by the `_ProfilePartial`.
            // The `assignAddressInputs` function is called in the `Scripts` section.
            // It's likely that `assignAddressInputs` is responsible for populating the hidden inputs in the form.
            // So, the fix for `Customer.cshtml`'s address fields needs to be within the `assignAddressInputs` function's logic,
            // which is generated by `Utils.GenerateAssignAddressInputsFunction`.
            // Since I cannot modify the `Utils` class, I cannot directly fix `Customer.cshtml`'s address input population.

            // Therefore, I will only provide the corrected `Seller.cshtml`.
